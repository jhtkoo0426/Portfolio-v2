                            <p>During university, I worked as a <span className='underline'>part-time business 
                                analyst</span> at Look4SchoolsUK, an education platform. In a span of 2 years, 
                                I developed a webapp prototype for the company, which identified and prevented 
                                loopholes in some of its planned features and web flows.I also helped with ad-hoc 
                                tasks including <span className='underline'>data collection and analysis</span> on
                                UK school data.</p>
