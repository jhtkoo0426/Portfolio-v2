                                <p>During university, I worked at Look4SchoolsUK, an education platform. In a span of 2 years, 
                                    I developed a webapp prototype for the company, which identified and prevented 
                                    loopholes in some of its planned features and web flows. I also helped with ad-hoc 
                                    tasks including <span className='underline'>data collection and analysis</span> on
                                    UK school data.</p>

                                <p>I had a lot of fun building the prototype webapp for the company. Although I had little
                                    web development experience in the past, I was able to quickly adapt by extensively
                                    going through Django tutorials and documentation.</p>

                                <p>I was fortunate to participate in the UCL Industry Exchange Network and worked on a 
                                    Natural Language Processing team project with the NHS. Although not being well-versed in 
                                    NLP, being able to think critically and learn quickly has helped me swiftly adapt to the 
                                    environment, and contribute to the project, as well as solving obstacles along the way. 
                                    Our solution is currently under evaluation and is a potential candidate to be distributed 
                                    as software within the NHS frontlines in the future.</p>
