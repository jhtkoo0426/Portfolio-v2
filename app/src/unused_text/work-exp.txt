I really enjoyed the process of building the prototype webapp for the company. Although 
I had little web development experience back then, I was able to adapt quickly with
the extensive Django tutorials and documentation.

I was able to visualise the data I had collected from previous tasks and generate interactive
graphs with Chart.js.

I was fortunate to participate in the UCL Industry Exchange Network with 2 teammates on a
Natural Language Processing project. Through gathering requirements, building prototypes 
and maintain frequent updates, our client was able to keep track of our process and made 
fine changes where appropriate.

The project problem itself was challenging for me. Although NLP was new to me at the time, 
being able to think critically and apply my machine learning knowledge occasionally has 
helped me adapt to the field quickly and contribute to the project, solving obstacles 
along the way.

In the end, our team successfully delivered our solution on time and we hope that it could 
someday be distributed as within the NHS frontlines to reduce their workload.
                

Okane queries financial data from finnhub.io to determine the market's attitude  towards 
a specific stock (overvalued or undervalued). I used sentiment analysis to process news
summaries of companies and time series forecasting to predict the future overall price 
trend of a stock.

Although naive, Okane can provide me with technical insight into the potential of
a stock using data analysis very quickly. This simple automation could be further developed
into a recommendation system that may make better decisions on trading strategies than 
myself :).
